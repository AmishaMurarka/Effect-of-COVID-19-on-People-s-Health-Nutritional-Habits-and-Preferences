## INTRODUCTION:

The COVID-19 pandemic that has spread rapidly and extensively around the world since late
2019 has had profound implications on food and nutrition. The unfolding crisis has affected
food systems and threatened peopleâ€™s access to food via multiple dynamics. On December
12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of
acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). On the 24th of April 2020, the number of
COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins
University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The
COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle
changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic
consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge
from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle,
social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Indians cannot hide their love for food as India being a diverse country offers various lip-
smacking delicacies. A sinful indulgence is no sin to us Indians and as far as food is concerned,

We hide our emotions behind it. But these emotions only end up showing in different parts of
the body by increasing the fat content and also increase in calorie intake that leads to fatal
consequences like high cholesterol levels, cardiac diseases and the list goes on.
The prevalence of the pandemic has brought about a tidal shift in consumer behaviour
globally. A sudden sense of enquiry has seeped into the minds of people. They want to know
what they eat, where it comes from, and how it is grown. The focus has shifted towards a
natural and holistic way of living. Through this study, we try to understand the effects of
COVID-19 on the health / nutritional preferences and habits of Indians.

## Research Methodology:

The survey was conducted from 13 dec-17th dec 2021.Our study aimed to investigate the
immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits, sleep pattern and physical
activity(exercise/yoga/meditation) changes among the population of Maharashtra within the
sampling frame of age group 18-40 years. Survey was created using Google Form. The study
comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired individual information regarding
(age group, gender, height, weight, level of education, location),Sleep pattern
information(average sleep hours, changes in sleep hours since covid),Dietary habits
information(healthy food consumption, outside food eat count, changes in diet due to
covid),Physical activity information(exercise count in week, started exercising before or since
covid)and additional questions like(self-health rating, health issues faced)

## Sampling Methodology:

Sampling technique used on the sample collection was convenience sampling as the data
represents outcomes for a particular age group.
Convenience sampling (also known as grab sampling, accidental sampling, or opportunity
sampling) is a type of non-probability sampling that involves the sample being drawn from
that part of the population that is close to hand. Convenience sampling can be used by almost
anyone and has been around for generations. One of the reasons that it is most often used is
due to the numerous advantages it provides. This method is extremely speedy, easy, readily
available, and cost effective, causing it to be an attractive option to most researchers.
SAMPLE SIZE: 52
